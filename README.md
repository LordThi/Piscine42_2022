# Piscine42_2022

This is all of my work during my Piscine in 42. Code is not perfect and I didn't wanted to push all of it. Maybe one day. This repo is just a personnal reminder. Rush01 is a try, it worked but not during the exam of the code.
All form C00 to C06 was Moulinette and Norminette proof.
I ereased the file in Rush00/exo3, cause.... if you're doing 42, you know.

## For People Who Are Trying Their Piscine

Please play the game. 

I know, rythm is short, days are short. I never coded before my piscine and this month was the best moment of education of my life. I learn a lot with the 42 method. Please trust the process.

And obviously: DO NOT COPY THIS PIECE OF ART. Teachers will know, they are watching you, fool.

Good Luck.
